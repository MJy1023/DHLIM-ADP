# DHLIM-ADP

This repository contains the official implementation of "Adaptive Dendritic Plasticity in Brain-inspired Dynamic Neural Networks for Enhanced Multi-timescale Feature Extraction" (Under Review at IEEE TNNLS).

## Coming Soon
ðŸš§ This repository is under construction. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

## Overview
We propose a novel brain-inspired dynamic neural network with two key innovations:
- **DH-LIM**: A Dendritic Heterogeneity Leaky Integrate Modulate neuron model that replaces traditional binary spike activation with a continuous modulation mechanism
- **ADP**: An Adaptive Dendritic Plasticity mechanism that dynamically adjusts dendritic decay factors based on input signal frequency characteristics

## Highlights
- Enhanced multi-timescale feature extraction capabilities
- State-of-the-art performance on EEG and ECG temporal sequence recognition tasks
- Efficient and biologically plausible neural dynamics
- Comprehensive evaluation on DEAP, ECG, and Alzheimer's disease datasets
